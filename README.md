# Context_Switching
Context Switching involves storing the context or state of a process so that it can be reloaded when required and execution can be resumed from the same point as earlier. Act of switching from one process to another is called a "Context Switch".Typically there are several tasks to perform in a computer system. So if one task requires some I/O operation, you want to initiate the I/O operation and go on to the next task. You will come back to it later. When you return back to a process, you should resume where you left off. For all practical purposes, this process should never know there was a switch, and it should look like this was the only process in the system.
